Inter360 is a website where you can view interiors with a 360 degree view.
To try the 360 features click on the gallery image and it will take you to the 360 views page of that room.


### Technologies :
360 views : <a href="https://pchen66.github.io/Panolens/" target="_blank">Panolens.js</a><br>
Doughnut Chart : <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a><br>
Bar chart : <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" taget="_blank">Chart.js</a><br>

The chart that's in index.html is just me trying to use some other libraries 


P.S. This website will be added into one of my portfolio. This is a portfolio project, not a real customer website
